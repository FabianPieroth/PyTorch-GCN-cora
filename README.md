# PyTorch-GCN-corma
A reimplementation of the paper Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks by [Kipf and 
Welling 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907) in PyTorch.
I will solely focus on reproducing the results for the cora dataset, which I pushed into the git
repository as it is not very large.




## Setup 
Run:

```
make environment 
source activate pytorch-gcn
make requirements
```
